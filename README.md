# search-bar

Let's create an animated search bar project with a neumorphism-designed magnifier icon. Clicking the magnifier reveals a search bar and microphone.
A second click returns it to its original size. We'll use JavaScript to add and remove classes for different search bar sizes. 
There's an animation for the microphone and search bar when we close and open it.
This project will teach you how to make a visually appealing and interactive search bar for your website.
